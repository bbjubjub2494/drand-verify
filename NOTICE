Preamble

    This library was developed partially as a side-project, partially
    as part of Simon's role as CosmWasm maintainer at Confio. It served
    as the basis for a proof of concept for drand beacon verification in
    CosmWasm, Terrand and Nois. In November 2022, ownership was transferred
    to Nois as it does not fit in Confio's or CosmWasm's core stack.
